WIP Plugin for VCV RACK2!
In this plugin you will find modules that work together well with Fundamental and 
try to add mainly control/utility functionality.
These are created with pretty specific use cases in mind, so I hope other people can enjoy them as well.
Any contributions are appreciated, and will be credited. 
I am not very familiar with C++ at all, nor am I interested in understanding the details of it.
I accept code changes, conventions and correction, but not lectures.

# History
I have been a user of VCV Rack since version 0.5.x. 
Recently I updated to RACK2 and noticed that some functions could be created, but where very cumbersome to create.
To this end I thought it would be a fun and fairly managable endeavour to develop a couple of modules.
